<p>This movie is one of my all-time favorites. Sean Penn's performance was so realistic and authentic that I literally cry every time I watch this movie. It tells the story of a developmenatlly disabled man named Sam Dawson. It follows his quest to regain guardianship of his daughter Lucy, after she is removed from his custody by the state for causing a disturbance at Lucy's classmate's birthday party. Being that I had two uncle's who dealt with mental and developmental disabilities, I appreciated this depiction of people living with disabilities.</p>

<p> This movie is one of my favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies. First of all Will Smith just makes any movie fantastic. The storyline is actually quite believable, which is slightly terrifying. The movie is set in Chicago in the year 2035, however since were nowhere near making use of technology in the way it was used in the movie, I'd say that I'll be long dead before witnessing anything that happened during this movie.</p>

<p>Do I really need to explain why I love this movie? The music, the storyline, IT"S LION KING! I cried when Mufasa died because I have a soul, and if you consider that a spoiler, then direct all complaints to whoever raised you, because who hasn't seen THE LION KING!</p>
